# VS Code Moderne Extension v0.1.1 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Extension Initialization Issue Fixed
- Fixed module resolution error for `fs-extra` dependency that prevented the extension from loading
- The extension now properly initializes without throwing module not found errors
- Resolved issue where `recipeService.js` could not find the `fs-extra` module at runtime

## Technical Details

The issue occurred because the `fs-extra` dependency was declared in `package.json` but not installed in the extension's `node_modules`. This caused the compiled JavaScript to fail when trying to import the module at line 28 in `services/recipeService.js`.

**Error resolved:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'fs-extra'
Require stack:
- /Users/merlin/.vscode/extensions/moderne.vscode-moderne-0.1.0/out/services/recipeService.js
```

**Solution:**
- Ensured all dependencies are properly installed via `npm install`
- Verified the extension builds and packages correctly with all required dependencies

## Installation

The extension can be installed by downloading the `vscode-moderne-0.1.1.vsix` file and running:
```bash
code --install-extension vscode-moderne-0.1.1.vsix
```

## What's Next

This patch release ensures the extension loads correctly. Future releases will focus on additional features and improvements to the Moderne CLI integration experience.
