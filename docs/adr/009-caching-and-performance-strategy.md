# ADR-009: Caching and Performance Strategy

**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** VSCode Moderne Extension - Phase 3 Performance Optimization

## Context

The extension performs expensive operations like CLI commands, repository analysis, and search across multiple repositories. Without proper caching and performance optimization, the user experience becomes sluggish with frequent delays.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered caching and performance optimization strategy:

### 1. Cache Service Architecture
- **CacheService**: Central caching with memory and disk persistence
- **Hierarchical Storage**: Memory cache with disk backup for durability
- **TTL Management**: Time-based cache expiration with configurable limits
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart invalidation based on file changes and CLI state

### 2. CLI Operation Caching
- **Command Result Cache**: Cache CLI command outputs by command hash
- **Repository State Cache**: Cache repository metadata and build status
- **Search Result Cache**: Cache search results with query fingerprinting
- **Configuration Cache**: Cache CLI configuration and validation results

### 3. UI Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Tree Providers**: Load tree items on-demand with virtualization
- **Debounced Updates**: Batch UI updates to prevent thrashing
- **Background Processing**: Long operations run in background with progress
- **Memory Management**: Proactive cleanup of large data structures

### 4. Search Performance
- **Result Streaming**: Progressive loading of search results
- **Query Optimization**: Optimize CLI search commands for performance
- **Pagination**: Limit result sets with on-demand loading
- **Index Caching**: Cache repository indices for faster subsequent searches

## Rationale

**User Experience**: Eliminates delays and provides responsive interface
- Commands execute immediately when cached
- UI remains responsive during long operations
- Background processing doesn't block user interaction

**Resource Efficiency**: Reduces CLI calls and system resource usage
- Avoid redundant expensive operations
- Memory-conscious caching with limits
- Disk persistence survives VSCode restarts

**Scalability**: Handles large repositories and result sets effectively
- Lazy loading prevents memory exhaustion
- Streaming results handle large datasets
- Efficient cache eviction prevents unbounded growth

## Implementation Details

### Cache Storage Strategy
```typescript
interface CacheEntry<T> {
    data: T;
    timestamp: number;
    ttl: number;
    access_count: number;
    key_hash: string;
}
```

### Cache Hierarchies
1. **L1 Cache**: In-memory, fastest access, limited size
2. **L2 Cache**: Disk-based, persistent across sessions
3. **L3 Cache**: Repository-level, shared across workspaces

### Performance Metrics
- Cache hit ratios tracked per service
- Operation timing measurements
- Memory usage monitoring
- User-visible performance indicators

## Configuration

```json
{
  "moderne.cache.enableMemoryCache": true,
  "moderne.cache.enableDiskCache": true,
  "moderne.cache.maxMemoryMB": 50,
  "moderne.cache.maxDiskMB": 500,
  "moderne.cache.defaultTTLMinutes": 30,
  "moderne.performance.lazyLoadingThreshold": 100,
  "moderne.performance.debounceDelayMS": 300
}
```

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Dramatically improved response times for repeated operations
- Better user experience with responsive UI
- Reduced load on Moderne CLI and system resources
- Scalable to large repository sets

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in cache management
- Additional memory and disk usage
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Potential for stale data if invalidation fails

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Cache statistics exposed through debug commands
- Automatic cache cleanup on startup
- User-accessible cache clearing commands
- Performance telemetry for optimization
